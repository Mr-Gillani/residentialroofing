            <h2>The Benefits of Two-Storey Homes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maximize Land Use:</strong> Building upward allows you to fully utilize your lot while leaving space for a garden, patio, or even a pool!</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Privacy:</strong> The separation of living and sleeping areas gives you quiet bedrooms even when guests are over.</li>
                <li><strong>Exceptional Views:</strong> Greenville’s lush greenery and stunning sunsets look even better from the second floor!</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Most two-storey homes are more energy-efficient because the upper level provides a natural buffer and reduces exposure to ground-level heat.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Simply put, you’re getting more value out of your property with the clever use of vertical space.</p>

                <li><strong>Green Escape:</strong> Add potted plants, hanging gardens, or even a small herb patch. A little greenery always boosts the mood.</li>
                <li><strong>Mood Lighting:</strong> String lights, solar lanterns, and uplighting can transform your deck for evening gatherings.</li>
                <li><strong>Multipurpose Zones:</strong> Want a lounging area and BBQ corner? Partition the space smartly for all your needs.</li>
            </ul>
